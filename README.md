# Module 11 – SQLAlchemy Model, Pydantic Schemas, Factory Pattern & CI/CD

This module implements the Calculation feature using SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, a Factory design pattern, and a full CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and Docker Hub. It includes unit tests, integration tests with PostgreSQL, Alembic migrations, and automated Docker image builds and pushes.

## Features Implemented

### SQLAlchemy Calculation Model
- Fields: id, a, b, type, result
- Enum-based operation types: add, sub, multiply, divide
- Alembic migrations fully functional

### Pydantic Schemas
- CalculationCreate for validating inputs
- CalculationRead for returning responses
- Validation prevents division by zero and invalid types

### Factory Pattern
Implements strategies:
- AddStrategy
- SubStrategy
- MultiplyStrategy
- DivideStrategy

This ensures extensibility for future operations.

### Testing
- Unit tests: Factory logic + Pydantic rules
- Integration tests: Database persistence using SQLAlchemy + Alembic
- All tests pass locally and in CI

## Run Tests Locally

pip install -r requirements.txt  
pytest -q

## Database Migrations

alembic upgrade head

## Build & Run Docker Image Locally

docker build -t module11-sql .  
docker run -p 8000:8000 module11-sql

## CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

Every push to main:
1. Installs dependencies
2. Runs tests
3. Builds Docker image
4. Pushes image to Docker Hub

Workflow file: .github/workflows/ci.yml

- Hashes the user password before saving it.
- Stores user details in the database.
- Returns the created user's public information.

### 2. User Login (POST /users/login)
- Verifies hashed passwords using a secure comparison algorithm.
- Validates credentials against stored user data.
- Returns a success message or token if implementing authentication.

---

## Calculation Endpoints (BREAD)

### Browse (GET /calculations)
- Returns a list of all saved calculations.

### Read (GET /calculations/{id})
- Fetches a single calculation by ID.
- Returns 404 if not found.

### Edit (PUT/PATCH /calculations/{id})
- Updates an existing calculation’s details.
- Validates input using `CalculationCreate` or relevant schema.

### Add (POST /calculations)
- Creates a new calculation.
- Validates input with `CalculationCreate` schema.

### Delete (DELETE /calculations/{id})

# Module14 Bread Dockerized Application

This repository contains a Python-based application packaged and deployed using Docker. The application uses FastAPI and SQLite. This document provides instructions for building, running, and pushing the Docker image.

Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sumanthchand23/module14/general

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system: [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Python 3.11 (for local development if needed)
- Docker Hub account
- `app/`: Contains the main application code.
- `test.db`: Initial SQLite database file.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `Dockerfile`: Instructions to build the Docker image.

## Usage Flow

Register: Navigate to /register to create a new user account.

Login: Log in with your new credentials at /login.

BREAD Operations: You will be redirected to /calculations, where you can perform all BREAD operations:

Browse/List: View all past calculations.

Add: Click the "Add New Calculation" link.

View: You can search for particular calculations based on their id.

Edit: Click the "Edit" link to modify the operands.

Delete: Click the "Delete" button.

 Executing Tests Locally

To prove the application's functionality and security, run the automated E2E tests.

## Dockerfile Overview

1. **Builder Stage**
   - Uses `python:3.11-slim` as the base image.
   - Installs build dependencies like `gcc`.
   - Copies `requirements.txt` and installs Python packages.

2. **Runtime Stage**
   - Uses `python:3.11-slim` as a smaller runtime image.
   - Copies Python packages from the builder stage.
   - Copies application code and `test.db`.
   - Exposes port `8000` for FastAPI.
   - Runs the application with Uvicorn.

## Building the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t module14_bread .
Running the Docker Container Locally
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 module14_bread
Visit http://localhost:8000 to access the application.
```
# **Module 15 – Advanced Feature Integration with FastAPI**
## I chose to add two new operands (power, mod) and i also added the report feature

This project extends a FastAPI web application by adding a new **calculations report feature** with full backend logic. front-end templates. authentication-protected access. and complete test coverage across unit. integration. and end-to-end (E2E) layers. The module also includes a fully automated CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions. which runs all tests. builds a Docker image. and pushes it to Docker Hub.

---

## New Feature: Calculations Report**

The new feature introduces a centralized page that summarizes a user’s calculation history. including:

- Total number of calculations  
- Averages of operands and results  
- Count of each operation type  
- List of recent entries  

The report supports:

- **HTML mode** → rendered at `/calculations/report`  
- **JSON mode** → returned when the client sends an `Accept: application/json` header  

This enhancement required coordinated updates across backend services. route logic. templates. authentication flow. and the testing suite.

---
