This experience helped me understand my strengths and the areas where I still need to grow. I realized that I naturally take ownership of problems and move quickly to find solutions, which is something I’m proud of. At the same time, I learned how important it is to slow down just enough to validate assumptions and communicate more clearly with others who are involved. I also recognized that asking the right questions early can prevent confusion later.

Overall, the situation pushed me to think more deliberately, pay closer attention to details, and balance speed with accuracy. It helped me become more intentional about how I approach challenges, and I’ll carry those lessons forward so I can make better decisions, support my team more effectively, and continue improving both technically and personally.
