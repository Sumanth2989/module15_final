Module 14:
The primary difficulty lay in resolving a complex series of cascading failures stemming from the authentication setup. This required: 1) Implementing a crucial fix in app/auth.py to truncate input strings before they were processed by the hashing function, directly resolving a fundamental limitation in the underlying cryptography library. 2) Systematically debugging persistent 422 Bad Request errors by confirming the integration test sends the login credentials as a JSON payload with the email key, thus aligning the test data structure with the application's actual router definition.

Once these core authentication and data format bugs were resolved, the entire suite became stable. The successful CI workflow now confirms all E2E tests (registration, login, BREAD operations) pass reliably, validating the use of the with page.expect_navigation(): wrapper for form submissions. This stability allowed the CI pipeline to successfully build the Docker image and push it to Docker Hub, completing the continuous deployment requirement.
