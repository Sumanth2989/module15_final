Module 15:
In this module. I built a new reporting feature for my FastAPI application. which helped me understand how backend logic. database interactions. front-end rendering. testing. and CI/CD pipelines all connect to form a complete production-ready workflow. I started by expanding the application to generate usage summaries for each user. including total calculations. averages. and operation counts. This required extending service logic and adjusting SQLAlchemy queries so the feature could compute meaningful aggregated data. I also created a dedicated HTML page to render the report in a clean format while supporting JSON responses for API clients. which helped reinforce how FastAPI handles content negotiation.

A major part of this module involved writing tests across different layers. Unit tests validated the report logic independently from the database. Integration tests verified that the route produced the expected JSON structure. And E2E tests confirmed the full flow in the browser. including authentication. navigation. and rendering the report template. Debugging these tests gave me a clearer understanding of state management. authentication dependencies. and the importance of consistent route behavior.

Once the feature worked locally. I updated the CI pipeline to run tests. build the Docker image. and push it to Docker Hub. Fixing issues in GitHub Actions and Docker taught me how small configuration mistakes can break an entire pipeline. By the end of the assignment. I had implemented a complete feature that touched every layer of the stack. while gaining confidence in testing. deployment automation. and full-stack FastAPI development.
