This assignment helped me understand how different backend components work together to build a complete FastAPI application. The main goal was to extend the Module 11 project by adding user registration, login functionality, and full BREAD operations for calculations. Through this work, I learned how to design proper Pydantic schemas, create secure password handling with hashing, and structure routers in a clean way that keeps the project maintainable.

One of the challenges I faced was dealing with password hashing using bcrypt. I ran into errors because bcrypt has a strict 72-byte limit for passwords, and understanding why that happened helped me learn more about how hashing libraries behave behind the scenes. Another important part of the project was writing integration tests. Getting the tests to run correctly in GitHub Actions required setting up a Postgres test database and ensuring the environment matched what I had locally. This process taught me how essential good test configuration is for consistent CI runs.

The CI/CD pipeline was another valuable learning experience. I configured GitHub Actions to install dependencies, spin up Postgres, run integration tests, and then build and push a Docker image on successful runs. Seeing everything automated from testing to deployment made me appreciate how real-world development teams rely on pipelines for reliability and speed. Overall, this module strengthened my backend development skills and gave me confidence in connecting code, tests, and automation into a fully working system.
